This past sprint has truly been integrating what we didn't integrate in the first sprint.  There were a ton of assets to transport over into the new environment, a couple GB, so it took quite a bit of time to fix the broken or misplaced assets.  As well, once we added the Oculus integration, a lot of scripts became messed up and didn't function properly with the Oculus.  We're still ironing out most of the viewing the scene with the Oculus Rift.  We have plans in the future to add a handheld UI to the project and to be able to move throughout the scene.  However, a lot of our Use cases weren't true features that the end user would see; it is more of adding integration and fixing errors that currently existed in the current version of the project.  Therefore, the user stories may be lacking some content, and we know they are lacking because there isn't much to say for these specific "features."  However, we will make sure future user stories aren't lacking with the handheld UI, it will have all of the diagrams properly organized.
